- wake up and start to work
- What is DoerLog
  - doer: someone who gets actively involved in something, rather than just thinking or talking about it.
  - log: a full, written record of a trip, a period of time, or an event
  - How did you do in the last day, last month and last year? How much effort did you put for the project? How many lines of code did you contributed last week? What is your diet look like?
